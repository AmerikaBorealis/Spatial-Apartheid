# Project Description
The Spatial Apartheid Project is a work of decolonial and qualitative geography. As allied settlers, reformed invaders, decedents of enslaved Africans, or colonized indigenous people on turtle island, a special responsibility is asked of us to use our resources, skills, talents, and know how to dismantle the colonial apparatuses that are within our personal sphere of influence.
