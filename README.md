# Spatial Apartheid
A qualitative study of apartheid

Welcome to the project readme file. Here, you will find helpful resources for understanding, ultilizing, and contributing to the Spatial Apartheid project.

Inspired by other qualitative spatial studies of settler colonial structures, such as [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/) produced by the University of Richmond and Dr. Robert K. Nelson, and the [DAIR](https://www.dair-institute.org/) research group, we work to create a publically accessible dataset that can be used in the research into native land disposession in the heart of empire.
